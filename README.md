# Ratpoision

Hide the mouse pointer, useful for full-screen/zen/focus modes.

The plugin adds several commands which you can assign to shortcuts, to buttons (using something like Commander) or you can just run using the command palette.

* `Ratpoison: Set active`
* `Ratpoison: Set inactive`
* `Ratpoison: Toggle active`

In the settings page you can activate/deactivate, and set if you want to show a text (and which one) in the status bar when active.

## Install

You can follow one of the following methods:

* Install from the community plugin registry under the name `Typing sounds`.
* Install using [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) with repository `jobedom/obsidian-typing-sounds`
* Install manually by copying the release files (`main.js` and `manifest.json`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ratpoison` in your vault.

Enjoy your writing!
